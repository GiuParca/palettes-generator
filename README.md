# Color Palette Generator

Creating your own color palette is just a click away.

Color Palette Generator is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing you to generate a unique, random color palette with a single click.

This project uses JavaScript DOM manipulation to dynamically add new elements to the HTML.

You can click a button to get a new burst of colors or select each individual color at random to create your own palette.
